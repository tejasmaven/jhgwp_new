Easily import data from any XML, CSV or Excel file to Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) with the ACF add-on for WP All Import.

== Description ==

The ACF Add-On for [WP All Import](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import/) makes it easy to bulk import data from any CSV or XML file into your ACF fields in WordPress in less than 10 minutes.

The left side shows all of the ACF fields that you can import to and the right side displays the data from your XML/CSV file.

Simply Drag & Drop the data from your XML or CSV into the ACF fields to import them.

The importer is so intuitive that it is almost like manually adding custom post type data in the Advanced Custom Fields plugin.

ACF CSV imports? ACF XML imports? They are EASY with WP All Import.

= Why you should use the ACF Add-On for WP All Import =

* Supports files in any format and structure. There are no requirements for the data in your file to be organized in a certain way. CSV imports into Advanced Custom Fields is easy, no matter the structure of your file.
* Import all basic fields such as text, numbers, range, email address URL, and password. Support for all other ACF fields in the Pro version of the ACF add-on.
* Imports files of practically unlimited size by automatically splitting them into chunks. WP All Import is limited solely by your server settings.

= ACF CSV Imports =

CSV is a common file format that's editable by major spreadsheet software. It allows you to easily add and edit ACF data and change column names.

When importing ACF data from CSV files, you should use UTF-8 encoding (which is very standard) if you are having any trouble with CSV imports containing special characters. But other than that, there are no special requirements.

This add-on is the best option for ACF CSV import tasks – our importer is extremely flexible when doing ACF imports because you don't need to edit your CSV files to import the data to Advanced Custom Fields. WP All Import can import ANY CSV file to ACF. You don't need to layout your data in a specific way, and you don't need your CSV to have specific column names. WP All Import's drag & drop interface provides you with a visual way to map the columns in your CSV file to the appropriate fields in Advanced Custom Fields.
